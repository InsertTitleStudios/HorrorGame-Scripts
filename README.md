Flashlight script has been more or less completed it lacks sound effects and flashlight model as well as battery models. Battery pickup I can change input to left click.

Checkpoint script switches respawn between multiple checkpoints, started adding in matches however upon collision with checkpoint it only deducts matches from 1 checkpoint instead of multiple. It also won't use input at the moment. E.g. Player is in checkpoint zone and press F to activate checkpoint providing they've correct amount of matches. Matches adding has been setup but still needs to be adapted and fixed cause I copied from flashlight script.
